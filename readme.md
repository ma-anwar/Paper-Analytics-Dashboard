#Paper Analytics Dashboard

A simple dashboard I made using Python, Pandas and Dash. This was my first time using Dash for data visualization.

I converted sample data from an excel spreadsheet to a csv and used Pandas to clean and process the data for presentation.

A live view of the dashboard is up on Heroku over [here](https://paper-analytics-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).

If it's not up anymore, you can clone the repo, pip install and then run `python app.py` and the dashboard will come up on localhost.
